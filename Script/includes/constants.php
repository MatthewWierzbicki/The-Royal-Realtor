At a whopping 300 square feet, it towers over many sheds in the area. Great for raising a fish in, the perfect neighbourhood to grow old in. In case on an apocalypse, this mansion is perfect to condition you to live a simpler life. It comes with several televisions(all of which run constantly, they can never be turned off; only down), a dog house, and a vintage custom faded fishing pole.");
